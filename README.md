# Spiritus

Fun, utility app for practicing multiple breathing techniques. The app also allows for usage tracking and additional metrics to help understand how and when breathing exercises are being used. Additional functionality will include audio cues, multi-modal input, including voice commands and mouth recognition for breathing syncronization.

Built quickly in React, with TypeScript and leveraging/exploring the MaterialUI library. I also building this an a native iOS app via SwiftUI, so I can use it on my watch.
